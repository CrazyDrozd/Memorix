# Memorix, a mini console project on Python
**Memorix** is a mini-project of mine that can be used to write notes in it with time and date saving in real time! 

It could be used for:
  * Brainstorms aka creating ideas for any project of yours
  * Quickly write your thoughts in it and then get back to them after
  * and other stuff!

It also has a lot of **features**:
  * **Quick and fast** — since it's in console state, it doesn't requires almost any of you memory and is fastly working, making it really easy to write your thoughts in.
  * **Manageable** — slash commands allow you to easily manage and interact with notes, quickly delete them, save or even to create a header with a different color for more further brainstorming.
  * **Easy configuration** — it's simple open-source code allows to mod this project and integrate more features into it.
 
Memorix contains localization system and two currently existing languages: **English** and **Russian**.

Available only on **Windows**.
